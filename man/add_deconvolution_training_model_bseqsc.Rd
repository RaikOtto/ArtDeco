\usage{
add_deconvolution_training_model_bseqsc(
    transcriptome_data,
    model_name,
    subtype_vector,
    marker_gene_list,
    training_p_value_threshold,
    training_nr_permutations,
    training_nr_marker_genes
)
}
\arguments{
\item{transcriptome_data}{Path to transcriptomic data to be
used for training. Has to contain the cell subtypes to which the
similarity will be calculated. Note that the row names have
to contain the HGNC symbols and the column names the sample names.}

\item{model_name}{Name of the model}

\item{subtype_vector}{Character vector containing the subtype
labels of the training data samples (\code{transcriptome_data})}

\item{marker_gene_list}{List that contains the marker genes
for each subtype. Has to be in the type of list() with each
subtype being an entry.}

\item{training_p_value_threshold}{P-value at which a training
is deemed successfull. Default value 0.05}

\item{training_nr_permutations}{Amount of perturbation which
results in a p-value. Higher number of perturbation generally
improves the p-value estiamtes. Default 100.}

\item{training_nr_marker_genes}{How many genes should be utilized
as list of marker genes. Default 100.}
}
\value{
Stores a new model in the package directory
}
\description{
\code{add_deconvolution_training_model_bseqsc} adds a new model
